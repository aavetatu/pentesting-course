### x) Listen and Summarize an episode of Darknet Diaries or Herrasmieshakkerit

I listened [*Teollisuusautomaation tietoturva, vieraana Jari Seppälä | 0x18*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2dFAyJ9kafdRxXAB7fwLTH?si=63eecdd695954778) by Herrasmieshakkerit

- Daily work of industrial automation contains anomaly management, teaching and research tasks
- Information security is an essential part of automation and of productivity and business continuity
- In automation technology, various safety measures must be taken against programming errors and cyber attacks 

### a) Install Kali Linux Virtual Machine

I started installing Kali Linux in VirtualBox by downloading KaliLinux VirtualBox image from [kali.org](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2023.1/kali-linux-2023.1-virtualbox-amd64.7z)
After the download was complete, I unzipped the file and opened it with VirtualBox
The file made a new virtual machine and I configured it to use 8GB of RAM because I have plenty of free RAM and 80GB of storage

### b) Install and configure Metasploitable 2 Virtual Machine

For this task I used Tuomas Valkamos guide on [installing configuring Metasploitable](https://tuomasvalkamo.com/PenTestCourse/week-2/)

I started by downloading Metasploitable2 from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)
I unzipped the file and opened VirtualBox
I added Metasploitable to my virtual machines by clicking *New*
For *Type* I selected *Other* and for *Version* I selected *Other/Unknown (64-bit)*

**I couldn't finish this task because VirtualBox didn't recognize downloaded metasploitable image**

### c) Configure host-only network

From VirtualBox I clicked top left corner File > Host Network Manager > Create
I selected DHCP Server and clicked "Enable Server" and after that *Close*
I selected my Kali VM Settings > Network > Adapter 2 and set *Attached to:* Host-only Adapter and *Name:* VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter #2
After I clicked *OK* and started my Kali machine

I opened terminal on Kali and pinged google.com to test my network connection
	
	$ ping google.com
	PING google.com (216.58.209.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from bud02s22-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.209.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=19.8 ms
	64 bytes from bud02s22-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.209.206): icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=13.8 ms
	$ ping 8.8.8.8   
	PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=58 time=16.1 ms
	64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=58 time=16.1 ms

This confirmed that my connection works so it was time to test if I can disconnect my machine from the internet to not break any laws accidentally

I opened Kali network settings and unticked Network Adapter #1
And tested connection again

	$ ping 1.1.1.1
	ping: connect: Network is unreachable
	$ ping 8.8.8.8
	ping: connect: Network is unreachable
	$ ping google.com
	ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution

Disconnecting Kali VM from internet worked

## Tasks d-f will be added later after all former steps have been completed
